# IOT-sleep-control-device

### ABSTRACT:


>Now a days stress levels, soaring workloads, extensive work timings tend to make us sleep departed knowingly or unknowingly. Sleep disorders cause more than just daytime sleepiness. They can take a serious toll on health, leading to memory problems, weight gain, impact on overall energy and mood; a well defined sleep pattern and snooze proof waking up is a dire need in present times. Considering this issue the concept of using a sleep control devices proposed, to monitor and aid in helping peaceful wakefulness and reduce the stress of the morning routine. To achieve this concept Raspberry pi is being used as the prime processor .

>The data from the sensors that are connected to the GPIO pins of the raspberry pi will be sent to the raspberry pi, from there it will be sent to the cloud using the in built Wi-Fi through MQTT protocol the data’s can be viewed in on web client application. This system will be surely helpful for the monitoring and reviving a content circadian rhythm resulting in a healthier lifestyle.
This project aims at building an alarm that is snooze proof.

>We tend to be the most efficient in the morning, with limited distractions and our will power maxed. As we wake up more efficiently, we’ll naturally get more done! It is beneficial for all its users as it makes you get you up on time without fail - feeling energized and motivated throughout your day by gaining some precious morning minutes. No more feeling late, rushed ,and stressed...The best way to keep yourself on track .
